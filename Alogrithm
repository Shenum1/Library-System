Algorithm for Library Management System

Step 1: Define the Book Class
1.	Create a Book class with the following attributes:
o	id: an integer representing the book's ID.
o	title: a string representing the book's title.
o	author: a string representing the book's author.
o	isBorrowed: a boolean indicating if the book is borrowed.
3.	Define a constructor to initialize the attributes.
4.	Define getter methods for each attribute.
5.	Define methods to borrow and return the book.
6.	Override the toString method to display the book details.
	
Step 2: Define the Library Class
1.	Create a Library class with the following attributes:
o	books: a list (e.g., ArrayList<Book>) to store the book objects.
2.	Define a constructor to initialize the book list.
3.	Define a method addBook(Book book) to add a book to the library.
4.	Define a method borrowBook(int bookId) to borrow a book:
o	Iterate through the book list.
o	If the book ID matches and the book is not borrowed, set its isBorrowed attribute to true.
o	If the book is already borrowed, display a message.
o	If the book ID does not match any book, display a "book not found" message.
5.	Define a method returnBook(int bookId) to return a book:
o	Iterate through the book list.
o	If the book ID matches and the book is borrowed, set its isBorrowed attribute to false.
o	If the book is not borrowed, display a message.
o	If the book ID does not match any book, display a "book not found" message.
6.	Define a method listBooks() to display all books in the library.
7.	Define methods to save and load the library state to and from a file using serialization.

Step 3: Define the LibrarySystem Class (Main Class)
1.	Create a LibrarySystem class with the main method.
2.	Instantiate a Library object.
3.	Use a Scanner object to read user input.
4.	Implement a loop to display the menu and process user choices:
o	Display menu options: add book, borrow book, return book, list books, save library, load library, exit.
o	Read the user’s choice.
o	Implement a switch-case or if-else structure to handle each menu option:
	Add Book: Prompt the user to enter book details and add the book to the library.
	Borrow Book: Prompt the user to enter the book ID and borrow the book.
	Return Book: Prompt the user to enter the book ID and return the book.
	List Books: Call the listBooks method to display all books.
	Save Library: Prompt the user to enter a filename and save the library state to the file.
	Load Library: Prompt the user to enter a filename and load the library state from the file.
	Exit: Exit the loop and terminate the program.
